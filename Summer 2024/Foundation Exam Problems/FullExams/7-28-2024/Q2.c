An algorithm processing an array of size n runs in 𝑂(𝑛√𝑛) time. For an array of size 10,000 the
algorithm processes the array in 16 ms. How long would it be expected for the algorithm to take when
processing an array of size 160,000? Please express your answer in seconds, writing out exactly three
digits past the decimal.
