/* (10 pts) DSN (Dynamic Memory Management in C)
Suppose we are planning a party and we would like to create an array to store our list of supplies. Currently
our list is stored in a text file with the name of each item to be purchased on a line by itself. Write a
function called make_grocery_list that reads these items from a file and stores them in a two-dimensional
character array. Your function should take 2 parameters: a pointer to the file and an integer indicating the
number of grocery items in the file. It should return a pointer to the array of items. Be sure to allocate
memory for the array dynamically and only allocate as much space as is needed. You may assume that all
of the strings stored in the file representing grocery items are alphabetic strings of no more than 127
characters (so the buffer declared is adequate to initially read in the string).
*/


#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <stdio.h>
char ** make_grocery_list (FILE *ifp, int numItems) {
char buffer[128];
char **list = NULL;
int i;



list = malloc(sizeof(char) * numItems);
for(i = 0; i<numItems; i++){
fscanf(ifp, "%c", buffer[i]);

}
}
// this is the end of my submission



//here is the beg of the correct submission:

list = malloc(sizeof(char *) * numItems);
// Grading: 6 pts - 1 pt loop, 1 pt read, 4 pts malloc,
 // 1 pt strcpy
 for(i = 0; i < numItems; i++) {
 fscanf(ifp, "%s", buffer);
 list[i] = malloc(sizeof(char) * (strlen(buffer) + 1));
 strcpy(list[i], buffer);
 }
// Grading â€“ 1 pt
 return list;
 // Grading notes - 1 pt off for = vs strcpy, 1 pt off for
 // forgetting the +1 in the inner malloc.

// the main difference between the correct and mine is that i got unsure and looked at the answer lol
//i dont think i would have been able to determine that i needed to allocate memory for each [i] of the list tho
//so basically i just needed to allocate memory for the iteration of the list in the size of the
//current buffer +1 bcs its a string, this makes it a 2D array
//finally i needed to return the list
//so if i hadnt stopped i wouldve gotten 5/9 which is pretty good, just needed to recognize the second need
// for allocation
