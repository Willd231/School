why is reviewing so much about trees 
surely we wont have a really hard tree assignment 

what's a tree? 
a plant 
a data structure

a data structure where each node is the child of exactly one other node except to root node 
easily to consider inductively or deal with it recursively 
a bst is a specific type of tree, at most 2 children 

the key has to be orderable 
a comparable type

i didnt go to lab so i didnt see the sorted collections 

complexity of BST 
all basic operations on bst take O(h) where h is the height 


insert, delete, retrieve, update 


valorant or overwatch 

fail, equal, less than, greater than 

never waste a mistake 
every single one should teach u 

logically the absolutely elementary collection is the set  

KEEP MALLOC AND FREE IN A CAGE DOUSED IN HOLY WATER!!!
C IS NOT A REAL LANGUAGE! 
JAVA HAS PROBLEMS BUT ITS ACTUALLY A REAL LANGUAGE!
