Had a little bit of a classroom issue
Today is going to be graph theory


Welcome back to computer science 2 ! 
Clearly in major schedule delay territory 
Program is due next week 
program is due when ? Next week 
Further extensions are unlikely


Thing 2 - 
we will still be having exam 1 Thursday night but we have until Monday to turn it in
