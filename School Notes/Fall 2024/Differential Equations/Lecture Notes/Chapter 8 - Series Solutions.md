The best tool for numerically approximating a function near a particular point is the taylor polynomial 

the taylor polynomial : 

f(x0) + f'(x0)(x-x0) + f''(x0)/2!(x-x0)^2 + f'''(x0)/3!(x-x0)^3 + f^n(x0)/n!(x-x0)^n = sigma(j, n = 0) f^j(x0)/j!(x-x0)^j


Series allow you to solve a lot of ODE that we didn't know how to before. 

y' = y -> y = Ce^x
