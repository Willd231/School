Separable Equations: \
a differential equation is separable if it can be written in the form: 
$$
dy/dx = g(x)p(y)
$$
the reason we say that it must be written in this form to be a separable equation is because when it is in this form we can easily separate the two variables onto either side i.e.:
$$
g(x)dx = (1/p(y))  dy
$$
Initial value problems: 
Initial value problems are not very different from normal ODES all you have to do is simply solve it, then using the initial values: solve for C and plug it in to get the exact solution
