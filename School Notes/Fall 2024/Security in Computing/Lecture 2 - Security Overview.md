Quick Overview - ok Maybe a little longer than quick all of this shit is vocab 
pull it together 
In chapter one of stallings and brown 
stallings - us 
brown - aussie 

5 Is
us canada britain newzealand and britain - all share a lot of security stuff 


Why do we do any of this stuff?
 Money Money Money Money lots of money is on the table 
automation can be a huge liability 
everything is so vulnerable 

CIA triad: 

C - Confidentiality:
	data 
	privacy 

I - Integrity
	data integrity 
	system integrity 

A - Availability
	ensuring everything actually works 


You can get confidentiality through about 5 steps:
- Encryption 
- Access control 
- Authentication 
- Authorization 
- Physical security 


Methods for getting Integrity:
- Backups
- Checksums 
- Data correcting codes 

Availability:
- Physical protections - locked in a room
- Computational redundancies - computers and storage devices serve as fallbacks 

Authenticity :
- digital signatures - specific person
- nonrepudiation - only one or few people

Accountability:
- make it so that everything can be traced back to the responsible party 


Levels of Impact 
- Low impact - limited actual effects on organization 
- Moderate impact - serious adverse effect on organization 
- High impact - severe or catastrophic effect on organization


Truly secure systems don't actually exist 
we as the designers have to find every flaw 

Vocab:
-  Adversary - threats to the system 
-  Attack - attack on the system
- Countermeasure - technique to combat the attack 
- Risk - expectation of loss as a probability of exploitation 
- Security policy - set of rules and stuff 
- System Resource - data contained in the system 
- Threat - potential violation of security
- Vulnerability - flaw or weakness in the system's design 

threats = knuckleheads who wanna get into our data 
everybody wants the data 

Types of attacks: 
- Active - an attempt to alter system resources or affect operation 
- Passive - attempt to learn or make use of the information inside of a system 
- Inside attack - attack initiated by an enemy inside of the security perimeter 
- Outside attack - initiated from outside of the security perimeter 

Countermeasure - any means taken to deal with a security attack:
- prevent 
- detect 
- recover 
countermeasures can introduce new vulnerabilities into the system


attack tree - a hierarchical structure that represents iterative refinement of the steps an attacker could take to breach security
