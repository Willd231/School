/*
4) (10 pts) DSN (Binary Trees)
Write a recursive function that takes the root of a binary tree (possibly NULL) and returns the
sum of all the nodes that are left children in the tree. See the example below, which returns 15 +
49 = 64, since the only nodes that are left children anywhere in the tree are 15 and 49.

 int data;
 struct node *left;
 struct node *right;

int add_all_left_children(node *root) {
