/*
An algorithm processes an array of size r by c in O(rc2
) time. For an array of size r = 200 and c = 500,
the algorithm takes 5.0 seconds. How long, in seconds, will the algorithm take to process an input array
of size r = 800 and c = 300? Please express your answer with exactly one digit after the decimal point.*/
