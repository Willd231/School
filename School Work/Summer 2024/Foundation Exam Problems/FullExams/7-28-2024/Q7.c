/*
An algorithm to find a particular value among n total values takes O(log(n)). On a data set with n = 230
,
it took 1.2 seconds to find the desired value. How many milliseconds will it take to find a value in a data
set with n = 220? (Note: For ease of computation, you may use a logarithm with base 2.)*/
