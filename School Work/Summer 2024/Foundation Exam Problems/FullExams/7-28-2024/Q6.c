/*Write an iterative, non-recursive function that takes the root of a trie (root) and a string (str) and returns
the number of new nodes we would have to add to our trie in order to insert that string. You may assume
that str is non-NULL, non-empty, and contains lowercase alphabetic characters only (i.e., it wonâ€™t contain
uppercase letters or non-alphabetic characters). However, you must handle the case where root is NULL.
Special Restrictions:
a. Please do not use pointer arithmetic (e.g., str + 1).
b. Do not modify or corrupt the trie or the string. (Do not add nodes to the trie!)
c. Do not call strlen() repeatedly, as it is an O(k) function (where k is the length of the string). If you
need to call strlen(), find a way to do it only once for the given string.
The trie node struct and function signature are as follows. Do NOT write any helper functions.*/


typedef struct TrieNode {
 struct TrieNode *children[26];
 int flag; // 1 if the string is in our trie, 0 otherwise
} TrieNode;
int newNodeCount(TrieNode* root, char* str) {
