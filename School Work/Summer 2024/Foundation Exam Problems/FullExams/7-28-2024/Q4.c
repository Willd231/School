/*List the ranges of all the integer values that would cause a double rotation to occur if inserted into the
following AVL tree (as opposed to a single rotation or no rotation at all). (For example: “-10 through -5
and any value greater than 93.”) You may assume we do not allow the insertion of duplicate values into
the tree. Note: A double rotation can alternately be described as a restructuring where, out of the
three nodes that need to move structurally, the new root node was previously two levels below the
node that needed to be restructured. These cases are also called the C-A-B and A-C-B cases.
